- General
	- VAE vs GAN
	- Generative models learn to produce *realistic* examples
	- Discriminative models distinguish between classes (*fake vs real*)
- Status
	- GAN's performance is rapidly improving :fire:
	- Major companies use them
- Discriminator
	- **Discriminator** is a classifier
	- It learns the probability of class Y (real/fake) given features X: $P(Y|X)$
	- Probabilities are the feedback for the generator
- Generator
	- The **generator** produces fake data
	- Learns the probability of features X: $P(X|Y)$
	- Takes as input random noise for different outputs each time
- BCE / Loss
	- The **BCE** cost function has two parts (one for each class)
	- Close to zero when the label and the prediction are similar
	- Approaches $\infty$ when the label and the prediction are different
- Training
	- GANs train in an alternating fashion
	- Both models should be of equal level, otherwise the feedback isn't useful
