# Lecture 3: Proteins

## Primary Structure
Building block: Amino Acid

20 Acids:
- 4 Polar Uncharged (S T N Q)
- 2 Polar Negative (D E)
- 3 Polar Positive (M R H)
- 8 Non polar (A V M L I F Y W )
- 3 Special (G C P)

> Side chains of polar, uncharged amino acids have polar covalent bonds, side chains of non-polar amino acids do not.
> Although both Cys and Met have sulfur in their side chains, only Cys can form disulfide bonds because only Cys has a -SH (sulfhydryl) group.


## Proteins Secondary Structure
> The secondary structure of a protein is a local region of alpha helix or beta sheet that is stabilized by Hydrogen bonds between N-H and C=O of the polypeptide backbone.
