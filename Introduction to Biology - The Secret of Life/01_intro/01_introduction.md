# Lecture 1 - Introduction

**My Goals**:
- Getting into Biology
- Understand fundamentals of life
- Understand treatments from *doctors*
- Deeper knowledge about cancer


## Revolution in Biology
- Medicine
	- Gene to feel pain
	- Breast Cancer
	- Skin Cancer
	- High cholesterol
- DNA Fingerprinting (crime)
- History (older species)
- Genetic engineering
	- Transgenic animals & plants


## **Not** in this course?
1. Stunning diversity of Life (but: similarities between species)
- Biosphere: Earth
- Ecosystems: Forest
- Organism: Human being
- Organ: Eye
- Tissue: Retina
- Cells: Rod Cell
- Organelles: Nucleus, Mitochondrion
- Molecule: DNA

2. Evolution (*billion years ago = BYA*)
- 4.5 BYA       - earth formed
- 4.0 BYA       - eather cooled
- 3.7 BYA       - 1st life Prokayetic
- 1.5 BYA       - 1st nucleated cells Eukaryotic
- 0.5 BYA       - Multicellular life
- 0.005 BYA     - 1st humanlike creatures
- 0.0001 BYA    - Homosapiens
- 0.0000002 BYA - MIT was founded

3. Cell Biology
- Eukaryotic: Animals, Plant, Fungi (big)
- Prokaryotic: Bacteria (small - no nuclide)


## Outline of Course
- Fundamental principals
- Intellectual Unification

### *Diagram*
- Biological Function
	- Biochemistry (Purify: 1 component away from the rest)
		- Proteins
	- Genetics (Organism *-* 1 Component)
		- Gene
	- Gene <DNA-RNA> Proteins: Molecular Biology
	- Recombinant DNA (read single gene)
- Genomic (observer of *all*)
