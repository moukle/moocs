# Lecture 2 - **Biochemistry** of Life

## 1. Death of Vitalism
- Sugar in Water
	- Bubbles after days (carbon dioxide `CO2` -> bread)
	- Alcohol (beer, wine)
	- Cloudy (Yeast - living organism)
- Buchner (1892): Yeast Juice carries out fermentation (enzymes)

> Vitalism was the idea that there were properties of life or living organisms that could not be understood by the laws of physics and chemistry.


## 2. Fractionating Life
Split life into cells

1. Atomic Composition
- Hydrogen: 63%
- Oxygen: 24%
- Carbon: 10%
- Nitrogen: 1.4%
- Phosphine: 0.2%
- Sulphur: <0.1%
- *Trace Amounts: Ca, Cl, K, Na, Mg, Mar, Se*

2. Molecular Composition
- Water/H2O: 80%
- Dry Weight
	- Protein: 50%
	- Carbohydrates: 15%
	- Lipids, Fats: 10%
	- Nucleic Acids: 15%


## 3. Covalent Bonds
Share electrons to complete outer ring

- Strong
	- single bonds + 80 KCal/Mol
	- double bonds +
	- triple bonds +

Random thermal Fluctuations + 0.6 KCal/Mol

Atom      | H | C | O    | N    | P | S
Max Bonds | 1 | 4 | 2(1) | 3(4) | 5 | 6(2)

Electronegativity (Greediness - how strong they pull electrons)
- O, N >> C, H
	- Polar Bonds:
		- (-) O-H (+): O pulls harder
		- (-) N-H (+): N pulls harder
	- Non-Polar Bonds:
		- C-C
		- C-H


## 4. Non-Covalent Bonds
1. Hydrogen Bonds ( 5 KCal/Mol )
Many `H2O`s act like magnets
(small insects can walk on the bonds)

2. Ionic Bonds
Atom switches group resulting in net negative and net positive. These attract each other with an `Ionic` Bond.

3. Van Der Waals Force ( 1 KCal/Mol )
- Two non-Polar bondings both have fluctuating charges. But they fluctuate in *concert*.
- C-C-H H-C-C
- Holds up geckos!

**Sum of Non-Covalent bonds adds up - in proteins they are > covalent bonds.**

> One covalent bond is stronger than one hydrogen bond, and one hydrogen bond is stronger than one van der Waals interaction.

4. Hydrophobic "Forces"
- Non-Polars mixing with Polar bonds:
	- Oil & Water not mixing!


## 5. Understanding Properties of Molecules
### 1. Example: Membrane

- `-C-C-C-C-C-C-` (+bonds top/bottom & a lot of H)
	- **Hydrophobic** vs Hydrophilic
- `-C-C-C-C-C-C-OH`
	- **Hydrophilic**
- `-C-C-C-C-C-C[--O][-OH]` (Glycerol)
	- **Hydrophilic**

- Fatty acids:
`-C-C-C-C-C-C[--O][-OH]`-`HO-C-H`
`-C-C-C-C-C-C[--O][-OH]`-`HO-C-H`
`-C-C-C-C-C-C[--O][-OH]`-`HO-C-H`
> Combined: Tri Acly Glyceride - **Triglyceride** -> **Hydrophobic**

- Phosphate (Hydrophobic & Hydrophilic -> Confused):
`-C-C-C-C-C-C[--O][-OH]`-`HO-C-H`
`-C-C-C-C-C-C[--O][-OH]`-`HO-C-H`
                             |  `O`
                           `-C-O-P-O`
                                `O`

- Phosphate = `~~~~~~~~o` (Head (o) Hydrophilic)
	- Heads together, Tails together

- Lipid Bilayer - MEMBRANE
	```
	oooooo
	~~~~~~
	~~~~~~
	oooooo
	```

> In an aqueous solution, micelles form with the tails facing inward, and the heads facing outward and interacting with the aqueous environment. When tails face outwards in a hydrophobic solvent, that is called a reverse micelle. The interactions with water are non-covalent hydrogen bonds. The aggregation of the phospholipids is driven by the hydrophobic effect in which non-polar molecules come together in a polar environment.

### 2. High Energy Molecule
- `Adenosine-Phosphate-Phosphate-Phosphate` (Hydrophilic-Hydrophilic)
- High Energy storage
- Adenosine Tri Phosphate (ATP)

### 3. Carbohydrates (Hydrophilic)
- (CH2O)6 [6H: Hexos, 5H: Pentos, 3H: Tricuse]
`O  OH H  OH OH H`
`C--C--C--C--C--C--H`
`H  H  OH H  H  OH`

- **Glucose** in *Circle*! Hexagon beside Hexagon beside ...
- Forming strong bonds holding up trees!
