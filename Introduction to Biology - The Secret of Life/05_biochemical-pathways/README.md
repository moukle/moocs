## Energetics of ~Pathways~ Reaction
G3P -> DHAP ($\Delta G0'=-186 kcal/mol$)

- A -> B
	- $\Delta G = \Delta G^0' + RT ln \frac {B}{A}$
		- $RT = 0.6$
	- $\Delta G < 0$ reaction runs forwards / favorable
	- $\Delta G > 0$ reaction runs backwards / unfavorable
	- $\Delta G = 0$ Equilibrium

- $G3P:DHAP = 1:30$
	- $\Delta G = -186 + 0.6 ln \frac {30}{1} = +0.8 (>0)$
	- Equilibrium: $1:22$

## Logical Tricks of Pathways
A -> B ($\Delta G > 0$ unfavourable)

1. Trick: Directly Coupled
	- A -> B ($\Delta G > 0$ unfavourable)
	- C -> D ($\Delta G << 0$ favourable)
	- A+C -> B+D ($\Delta G < 0$ favourable)

	- ATP
		- `adenecine - triphosphate`
		- burn one: ATP -> ADP ~-7.3kcal/mol

2. Trick: Indirectly Coupled
	- A -> B ($\Delta G > 0$)
	- B -> C ($\Delta G << 0$)

> Enzymes cannot make an energetically unfavorable reaction favorable. Enzymes only increase the rate of a favorable reaction.

## Breaking of Sugar: Glycolysis
- Hexose $C_6 H_{12} O_6$
	- 2 ATPs, $2NAD^+$->  Glycolysis -> Pyruvate (Produces 4 ATPs, 2 NDAH)
		- Yeast -> Methanol + $CO_2$
		- Lactic Acid

> The more negative the  ΔG , the more thermodynamically favorable the reaction is to go forward. And as Professor Lander indicated, if we want to understand the thermodynamics of what is happening under cellular conditions, we need to use  ΔG , not  ΔG∘  (since the cell is not under "standard" conditions, it is under the particular biochemical conditions of the cell).

## Regulation of pathways
- A -> B -> C
	- D -> E -> F
	- G -> H -> I

- Allosteric Regulation (F binds to protein)
